# Statistics & Data-Visualization---FIFA21-Poster

This project is created for the Statistics course in NOVA Information Management School. This project aims to answer popular football questions using statistical analysis on FIFA21 player dataset. We also used Self Organizing Maps and Hierarchical Clustering to cluster the entire player dataset based on their overall attributes.

You can refer to the Jupyter notebook to review the codes & graphs used during the analysis, or directly view the poster pdf.
